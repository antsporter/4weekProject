# 4weekProject

* Why are we doing this?

- To test our learnings from the academy and compound our knowledge plus learn new skills and logic along the 4 weeks of the task.


* How I expected the challenge to go. 

- I expected it to be a fun and interesting challenge. I knew i could do some of the concepts required to meet the brief but some would be a stretch which i would need to learn and speak to my colleagues on the programme.


* What went well?

- Working with Abdul for the first few hours was really helpful for us both to pick eachothers brains and crank out the work without getting stuck. 
- Using the internet to learn new techniques and functions was a great use. Developing dynamic tables, use of hero images and video's helped style my page.

* What didn't go as planned?

- The length of time it took to create the first iteration of pulling the data from the js file as the array into a table. This took almost a day and really wasn't that hard!


* Possible improvements for future revisions of the project. 

- Continue to use people around me, they are the key to success rather than always trying to go it alone.
