# 4weekProject

* Why are we doing this?

- To test our learnings from the academy and compound our knowledge plus learn new skills and logic along the 4 weeks of the task.


* How I expected the challenge to go. 

- I expected it to be a fun and interesting challenge. I knew i could do some of the concepts required to meet the brief but some would be a stretch which i would need to learn and speak to my colleagues on the programme.


* What went well?

* What didn't go as planned?
* Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
